Material/Coating Inference (heuristic)
======================================

Top votes:
  - polished_aluminum: 65.91
  - titanium_with_oxide: 28.82
  - stainless_or_nickel_chrome: 13.47
  - anodized_aluminum_clear: 11.85
  - gloss_coated_polymer: 10.93

Notes:
- Results are heuristic; confirm with XRF if possible.
- Specular sharpness trends + u'v' drift help distinguish polished Al vs NiCr vs Ti-oxide.
- FFT peaks around 50/60 Hz suggest mains flicker; other stable peaks may indicate internal modulation.
